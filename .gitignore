# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/certification_app/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/certification_app/db/*.sqlite3
/certification_app/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/certification_app/log/*
/certification_app/tmp/*
!/certification_app/log/.keep
!/certification_app/tmp/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development
/certification_app/storage/*
!/certification_app/storage/.keep

/certification_app/node_modules
/certification_app/yarn-error.log

/certification_app/public/assets
.byebug_history

# Ignore master key for decrypting credentials and more.
